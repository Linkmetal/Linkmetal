My name is Carlos Javier Díaz Falcón, I'm from Canary Islands (Spain) and I'm a programmer specialized on web development and design.

I consider myself a self-taught person, hardworking, wich learns and adapts quickly at the work enviroment; very perfectionist with my work, and always disposed to learn new knwoledge aswell to share the ones that I already know to other people.
